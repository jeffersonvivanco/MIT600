Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

- Period: end of sentence.
- Space: splits a word from another word
- Special chars: ignored

Algorithm:

- Read line
- Split sentences with period
- Check words with words in dictionary. Note: Will check only half the words
- record in a table the shift number as key and number of words found in dictionary as value
- keep track of max
- use max shift to decode the message to decode the message


Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:

Algorithm (Use recursion):

- Find best shift for sentence (will return order of shifts)
- apply shifts to sentence until there are no more words to decrypt
