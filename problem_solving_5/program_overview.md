# RSS Feed Filter
This program monitors feeds over the internet. The program will filter the news, alerting the user when it notices a news
story that matches the user's interests.

## RSS Overview
* Many websites have content that is updated on an unpredictable schedule. News sites, such as Google news, are a good
example of this. One tedious way to keep track of this changing content is to load the website up in your browser, and
periodically hit the refresh button.
* Fortunately, this process can be streamlined and automated by connecting to the website's RSS feed, using an *RSS feed
reader* instead of a web browser (e.g. Sage). An RSS reader will periodically collect and draw your attention to updated
content.
* RSS stands for *"Really Simple Syndication."* An RSS feed consists of (periodically changing) data stored in an XML-format
file residing on a web-server.
